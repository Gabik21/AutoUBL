# banlist-url: The URL to check for the banlist
# max-bandwidth: The maximum bandwidth to allocate to loading the banlist in 
#                kB/sec (faster values load the banlist quicker, lower values 
#                reduce the impact of denial of service attacks from the banlist 
#                server)
# timeout: The time in seconds before the connection to the banlist server times 
#          out (longer time deals with larger banlists better, shorter time
#          reduces the duration of denial of service attacks from the banlist

#                      for startup only)
